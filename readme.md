# Wasm QR code generator with Fermyon Spin and C#

*This repository is an adaptation of [Filip W's awesome article](https://www.strathweb.com/2022/12/dotnet-wasi-applications-in-the-cloud/) exploring .NET WASI applications in the Cloud. The original repository can be found at https://github.com/filipw/dotnet-wasi-demos*.

This project is using the [.NET 7 tooling for WebAssembly](https://github.com/SteveSandersonMS/dotnet-wasi-sdk), and the [Spin SDK for .NET](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/webassembly-for-dotnet-developers-spin-sdk-intro).
